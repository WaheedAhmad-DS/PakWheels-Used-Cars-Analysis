## Introduction to Project 
PakWheels is one of the biggest online marketplaces in Pakistan for buying and selling used cars.             

***What intrigued my interest in this project?***              

I own a Honda Civic 1.8 iVTEC 2016 model, black color and approximately 80,000 KM driven at the moment of writing this report. I wanted to sell it; thanks to high fuel prices and overall skyrocketing inflation rate. I decided to buy a more fuel-efficient or hybrid car. You might ask why not Electric Vehicle. Because EVs are not common in Pakistan, currently due to energy crisis, rarity of charging stations and high inflation rate (yes inflation again), it was not an option. Therefore, I wanted to analyze some data related to used cars and see insights regarding correlations between price and other factors such as, model year, mileage, transmission type, body type and even may be color (People here love black colored cars, even though in summers it's unbearable).          

I also wanted to see what maximum legitimate price can i set for my car and what other options are available in that price range.       

Side note: I also like black colored cars ü§ê.  

***So, which car did i decide to buy?***        

The answer will be revealed gradually in the steps below.

## Project Explanation through CRISP Methodology
Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) is a process, a methodology, or a framework developed by IBM. A data science team, whenever embarking on a new project, can implement this method for better results and ultimately successful decision-making at the end of the project. 

***Why did i choose this methodology?***

Although it is not the only model out there, but i actually believe that it is the best. It gives you a path and understanding of your tasks beforehand. 

So let's dive into the steps but with out project explanation in mind.
