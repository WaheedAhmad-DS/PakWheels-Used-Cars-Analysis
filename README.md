## Introduction to Project  
PakWheels is one of the biggest online marketplaces in Pakistan for buying and selling used cars.             

***What intrigued my interest in this project?***              

I own a Honda Civic 1.8 iVTEC 2016 model, black color and approximately 80,000 KM driven at the moment of writing this report. And I wanted to sell it and buy a more fuel-efficient or hybrid car, because EVs are not common in the Pakistan, currently due to energy crisis and high inflation rate. Therefore, I wanted to analyze data related to used cars and see some insights regarding correlations between price and other factors such as, model year, mileage, transmission type, and even may be color (People here love black colored cars, even though in summers it's unbearable).          

Side note: I also like black colored cars ü§ê.  

***So, which car did i decide to buy?***        

The answer will be revealed gradually in the steps below.
